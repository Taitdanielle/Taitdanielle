### About me myself and I
---
My names Danielle 


I am from Scotland and slowly but surley a full stack Software Developer in the making! 

I have always been interested in coding but never really had the confidence in myself to go for it. I'm **dyslexic** and have **ADHD** so that played a part in my non excistannce in my self confidence. But here we are I done an intence bootcamp coding course with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) and I passed with a **2nd class honors degree** in **Full Stack Software Development**. 

I have how ever been a bit slow with trying to build a portfolio, it is in the making though. 

Unfortunetly real life gets in the way a bit to much at the moment..
But it is a work progress and I will hopefully have something fab to show soon I promise! ðŸ’Œ :pray:
