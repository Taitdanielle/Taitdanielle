### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Danielle Tait!

I'm from Scotland and Slowly but surley a full stack Software Developer in the making! I have always been interested in coding but never really had the confidence in myself to go for it. I'm **dyslexic** and have **ADHD** so that played a part in my non excistant self confidence. But here we are I done an intence bootcamp coding course with [https://codeinstitute.net/](The Code Institue) and I passed with a 2nd class honors degree in Full Stack Software Development. 

I have how ever been a bit slow with trying to build a portfolio it is in the making though. Unfortunetly real life gets in the way a bit to much..But it is in progress and I will hopefully have something fab to show soon promise!
